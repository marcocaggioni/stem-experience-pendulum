# Galileo and the Pendulum

Galileo Galilei, the renowned Italian scientist, is credited with discovering the remarkable properties of the pendulum in the late 16th century. Galileo first noticed the regular motion of a swinging lamp in the cathedral of Pisa. He observed that, regardless of how wide the lamp swung, the time it took to complete each swing stayed nearly the same. He measured that by countng how many pulses a swing would take. This observation led Galileo to investigate the isochronism of pendulumsâ€”a property where the period of swing is nearly constant, depending primarily on the length of the pendulum rather than the amplitude or even the mass. Galileo's pioneering insights laid the foundation for the development of accurate timekeeping devices and started what we describe as modern science.
