# Galileo and the Pendulum

Galileo Galilei, the renowned Italian scientist, is credited with discovering the remarkable properties of the pendulum in the late 16th century. Galileo first noticed the regular motion of a swinging chandelier in a cathedral and, with careful observation, realized that each swing took the same amount of time. This discovery helped lay the foundation for modern science and timekeeping!

## 3D Printed Case

You can use a 3D printed case to securely hold the micro:bit and its battery. For example, see this model:

# Setting Up the Experiment

Let’s get started with a fun experiment to discover how a pendulum moves—just like Galileo did! You’ll use two micro:bits for this activity, and each one has a special job.

## What You Need

- **Micro:bit 1:** This one will ride on your pendulum! Put it in a 3D printed case (with two AAA batteries) and hang it on a string so it can swing back and forth.
- **Micro:bit 2:** This one stays safely connected to your computer using a USB cable. It will “listen” for signals from the swinging micro:bit and show you what is happening!

## How Does it Work?

- **Micro:bit 1** measures how much it’s speeding up or slowing down (that’s called “acceleration”), how bright the light is, and how loud the sounds are. It sends all this information through the air using radio waves.
- **Micro:bit 2** waits for these messages and then draws a graph on your computer, so you can see exactly what’s happening while the pendulum swings!

Did you know? When the pendulum micro:bit sends an acceleration value of 980, that means the real acceleration is 9.8 m/s² (the same as gravity on Earth!).

## Coding Your Micro:bits

### Code for the Pendulum Micro:bit (Micro:bit 1)

Copy and paste this code into the MakeCode editor for your first micro:bit (the one on the string):

<img width="1911" height="861" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d85d1e2b-70f6-408f-bac2-f1a6168959a0" />

```typescript
radio.setGroup(1)
basic.forever(function () {
    radio.sendValue("acceleration", input.acceleration(Dimension.Strength))
    radio.sendValue("light", input.lightLevel())
    radio.sendValue("noise", input.soundLevel())
})
```

This code tells the micro:bit to:
- Join a radio group (so it can “talk” to its partner)
- Send out its acceleration, light, and noise data over and over again

### Code for the Receiver Micro:bit (Micro:bit 2)

For the second micro:bit (plugged into your computer), use this code:

<img width="1911" height="861" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b9b30d-3ea2-495c-8b29-634462baef37" />


```typescript
radio.onReceivedNumber(function (receivedNumber) {
    serial.writeValue("acceleration", receivedNumber)
})
radio.setGroup(1)
serial.redirectToUSB()
```

This code tells the micro:bit to:
- Listen for acceleration values from the first micro:bit
- Send those values straight to your computer, where you can graph them

## Getting Ready to Experiment

1. Hang Micro:bit 1 (with batteries) on your string pendulum.
2. Insert the batteries and make sure the micro:bit is turned on.
3. Plug Micro:bit 2 into your computer’s USB port.
4. Download and upload the correct code to each micro:bit.
5. Start swinging the pendulum and watch the data appear as a graph on your computer!

Enjoy exploring science like Galileo—with a digital twist!
